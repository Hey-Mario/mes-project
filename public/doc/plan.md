To structure your project and apply the 23 design patterns, you can follow the guidelines below. Each pattern is mapped to a specific part of the system based on the provided document.

### Creational Patterns
1. **Singleton**: Ensure a single instance of database and configuration services.
   
```js
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
  return new PrismaClient()
}

declare const globalThis: {
  prismaGlobal: ReturnType<typeof prismaClientSingleton>;
} & typeof global;

export const prisma = globalThis.prismaGlobal ?? prismaClientSingleton()

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalThis.prismaGlobal = prisma
```


2. **Builder**: Facilitate complex creation of product configurations or production plans.
   - Create a `ProductBuilder` class to build product configurations.

3. **Prototype**: Clone equipment configurations or process parameters.
   - Implement a `clone` method in your equipment or process parameter classes.

4. **Factory Method**: Create instances of different production orders or notifications.
   - Define a factory interface and concrete factories for different order types.

5. **Abstract Factory**: Produce families of related objects like machines or tools.
   - Create an abstract factory for machine and tool creation.

### Structural Patterns
1. **Adapter**: Integrate machines from different manufacturers or third-party ERP systems.
   - Implement adapter classes to unify interfaces.

2. **Bridge**: Separate production process abstractions from implementations.
   - Use bridge pattern to decouple process logic from specific implementations.

3. **Composite**: Organize production components or tasks hierarchically.
   - Implement composite pattern for task management.

4. **Decorator**: Add functionalities like status notifications or enhanced security.
   - Use decorators to extend process functionalities dynamically.

5. **Facade**: Simplify interactions between different production modules.
   - Create a facade class to provide a simplified interface to complex subsystems.

6. **Flyweight**: Optimize memory usage for shared product or material details.
   - Implement flyweight pattern for shared data.

7. **Proxy**: Control access to critical production information or machine commands.
   - Use proxy pattern to manage access control.

### Behavioral Patterns
1. **Chain of Responsibility**: Manage process modification approvals.
   - Implement a chain of responsibility for approval workflows.

2. **Command**: Encapsulate actions as objects for complex and schedulable operations.
   
```js
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const data = await req.json();
    console.log(data)
    
    const validation = createProductSchema.safeParse(data);
    if (!validation.success)
      return NextResponse.json(validation.error.errors, { status: 422 });

    const product = await prisma.product.create({ data });
    return NextResponse.json(product, { status : 201});
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```


3. **Interpreter**: Parse and execute complex automation scripts or commands.
   - Implement an interpreter for automation scripts.

4. **Iterator**: Sequentially traverse production orders or material batches.
   - Use iterator pattern for collections.

5. **Mediator**: Coordinate interactions between planning, production, quality, and storage modules.
   - Implement a mediator to manage module interactions.

6. **Memento**: Save and restore previous states of process configurations or machine parameters.
   - Use memento pattern for state management.

7. **Observer**: Notify operators or managers of production changes or maintenance alerts.
   - Implement observer pattern for event notifications.

8. **State**: Change machine or process behavior based on their state.
   - Use state pattern to manage machine states.

9. **Strategy**: Modify quality control algorithms or planning logics.
   - Implement strategy pattern for algorithm selection.

10. **Template Method**: Define the skeleton of a production process, allowing subclasses to redefine steps.
    - Use template method for process definitions.

11. **Visitor**: Apply maintenance, inspection, or audit operations on equipment or processes.
    - Implement visitor pattern for operations on equipment.

### Example Implementations
- **Singleton**: `src/lib/prisma.ts`
- **Command**: `src/app/api/product/route.ts`

### Conclusion
By applying these design patterns, you can create a robust, flexible, and maintainable MES system. Each pattern addresses specific design challenges, contributing to a well-architected solution.
